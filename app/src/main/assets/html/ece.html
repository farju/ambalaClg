    I am delighted to welcome you to the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. Ever increasing pace of development in electronics has made an Electronics Engineer a catalyst for the change of the modern society. Electronic gadgets and communication systems of present age have tremendously improved the quality of life.
    It has become essential to have more efficient communication network with the latest electronic
    devices and circuits.br><br><br>

    Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the premier branch in this prestigious Institution.
    The department is established in 2002 with well equipped labs, excellent infrastructure and highly qualified faculties.
    Department has various labs such as analog electronics, digital electronics, microprocessor and microcontroller, electronics workshop, semiconductor devices, microwave engineering,
    optical fiber, communication engineering, audio visual, MEMS and fabrication lab,
    antenna design and project lab.<br><br>

    Centre for Research in Electronics Engineering (CREE) has developed more than 30 product based projects
    for the local industries under the MoU between ACE-CREE and ASIMA-MCG
    ( Ambala Scientific Industries Manufacturers Association- Microcontroller Group).<br><br>

    We are committed to give our students an outcome based education through outcome
    based teaching and learning process which provides them an environment to develop
    critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they advance through the programme.
    In addition to classroom teaching, the students are guided and motivated to implement practically
    the principles learnt in classrooms through experimentations in the laboratories which help students
    gain confidence and become skilled engineering professionals.<br><br>
