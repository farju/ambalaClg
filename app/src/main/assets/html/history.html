    With a view to make available enormous opportunities for the rural
    masses in higher and technical education, Honorable Dr Jai Dev, a
    social reformer in true sense, vowed to establish an ambitious project
    of an engineering college at this interior, but a well connected place to Ambala.<br><br><br>


    Ambala College of Engineering and Applied Research (ACE) has been established in the year
    2002 by Shri Ram Swarup Memorial Trust. The institute is affiliated to Kurukshetra University,
    Kurukshetra, Haryana, India. Ambala College of Engineering and Applied Research (ACE) is managed
    by Shri Ram Swarup Memorial Trust, the Trustees include Engineers with Masters and Doctorate degrees
    from renowned Universities in USA, such as University of California, Berkeley, Santa Clara University
    and Polytechnic University of New York.
    They have a vast experience in the field of education and high-tech entrepreneurship.<br><br><br>


    The college campus is spread over an area of 27 acres and has built-up area of 22296.30 Sqm
    (Including 4-Academic Blocks, 2-Boys Hostel,2-Girls Hostel,1-Director's Residence,
    1- Guest house and 4- Faculty's Residence Blocks, Guest House, Student
    Activity Centre and Canteen. For economic growth and prosperity, the need is to produce professional
    engineers by imparting quality education to the students. Guided and graded classroom instructions,
    interactive tutorial sessions, hands-on laboratory experience, interaction with successful entrepreneurs
    and visiting faculty will help the students to develop self-confidence to face the future and turn the
    problems into opportunities. This is the primary objective at ACE besides granting a degree. The vision
    is for educating a 'complete person' for a life of service and
    leadership by focusing on a value-oriented curriculum, dedicated to educating students for competence,
    conscience and compassion.<br><br><br>


    When Ambala College of Engineering and Applied Research (ACE) was started,
    it was often said that applied research was not possible at B.Tech level, especially in the new institutes.
    However, the vision of the founders was very clear that this is the need of the hour. Unless
    a change in the direction of engineering education was brought about, the quality of engineers
    in the country will not improve.<br><br>
