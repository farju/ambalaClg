    ""Scientific learning is best achieved by doing science""<br>

    This teaching philosophy enables student community to learn and simultaneously make
    scientific contribution to society. We are committed to deliver an excellent
    graduate program of study as well as provide an opportunity for cutting-edge research
    in all natural and applied sciences.<br><br><br>

    Applied Sciences encompasses following departments: Chemistry, English, Environment Sciences, Management, Mathematics, and Physics.
    Our faculty members adhere to the possibly high standard of teaching and actively
    work to involve students fully in the educational experience.
    We try to provide a liberal arts curriculum that ensures an interdisciplinary learning
    for educating the person, mind, body, and spirit.<br><br>


    The additional feature of this department is our Personality Development Program. This program helps the budding engineers
    to develop their communication skills by preparing them for working
    in their specific fields as an expressive professional.<br><br>

    I humbly invite you to the department website and study our programs to learn
    more about the myriad of activities and opportunities available at ACE.
    Find your passion and engage us to help you explore and grow. Hoping that
    I have communicated my excitement for our program I extend an invitation to visit ACE.<br><br>
