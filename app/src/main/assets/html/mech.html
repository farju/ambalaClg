    A very warm welcome to all.<br><br>

    I take the privilege to welcome you all to the Department
    of Mechanical Engineering at ACE. The discipline of Mechanical Engineering
    has a long and distinguished history of innovative invention and technological
    breakthroughs that have tremendously benefitted the progress of man and society.
    The Department of mechanical engineering , which is foundation of engineers came
    into existence at ACE in the year 2002. Since then the department of Mechanical Engineering
    strives hard to acquaint the budding engineering to sharpen their core engineering skills by taking
    up theoretical and practical measures in requisite quantum.<br><br>


    Our Laboratories have been very well established not only to cover
    complete syllabus but to motivate students to learn beyond the syllabus
    which definitely develops complete knowledge of the subject (both the practical
    and theoretical depth of knowledge) and develop skill sets to become promising engineers in future.<br><br>

    The department has well qualified faculty and staff members who are available to the students all the times.
    The faculty members in addition to regular teaching are also busy in consultancy services to local industry.<br><br>

    I wish to take the opportunity to assure you that I will try my best to maximize students participation
    in the department and will keep the admin transparent.<br><br>
